**********************
Performance Benchmarks
**********************

**ypres** was compared against two other popular serializer frameworks:

  - `marshmallow <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org>`_
  - `Django Rest Framework Serializers
    <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/>`_

These graphs show the results. The benchmark scripts are found in the
`benchmarks <https://github.com/rism-digital/ypres/tree/master/benchmarks>`_
directory in the **ypres** `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/rism-digital/ypres>`_. Run these benchmarks yourself with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/rism-digital/ypres.git && cd ypres
   $ tox -e benchmarks

Results
=======

These benchmarks were run on a Lenovo T530 with a 2-core 2.5 GHz i5 processor
and 8G of memory.
